### Introduction ###

This is going to be an accelerated introduction to the Ruby language. It is meant for the intermediate beginner. I assume you have some exposure to programming languages in general and do not require that much hand-holding.

My goal is to provide to you a top-down view of the Ruby language as a whole. 


### Printing and Variables ###

The very familiar (not to mention trite) hello world example is:


	puts ("Hello World!") # Say Hello World


That''s all there is to it in Ruby. As you continue, you are going to find that Ruby is all about making your life easier. That''s part of the whole ''programer happiness'' philosophy that Ruby subscribes to. Comments in code start with the hash (#) symbol. 

Note small things like parentheses are optional. The following code would work just the same:

	puts "Hello World"

Since Ruby is a dynamic loosely-typed language, there is no need to declare or specify the type of variables. Variables can be named anything outside of the language keywords and they are case-sensitive. A common habit amongst Ruby programmers is to use descriptive variable names that are separated with an underscore.


	first_name = "cyrus"
	last_name = "lopez"
	full_name = first_name + last_name
	puts full_name

The output would be:

`cyrus lopez`

Notice that the **+** operator works on strings. The Ruby interpreter will automatically figure out what you are trying to accomplish and do the most logical thing. 

	one = 35
	two = 678
	sum = one + two
	puts sum

The output would be:

`713`

Constants are similar to variables, except, well, the values are not supposed to change. Ruby does support constants, but to a limited extent. 
Any variable name which begins with a capital letter will become a constant, however, Ruby will not stop you from changing the value of the constant. Instead, it will only throw a warning during run-time. 

	Tom = "male"
	puts Tom
	Tom = "Female"
	puts Tom

The output would be:

`male` 
`test.rb:3: warning: already initialized constant Tom` 
`Female`

### Arithmetic ###

Dealing with basic arithmetic in Ruby is fairly standard. Ruby reduces your selection of numbers to be integers and floating-point numbers. Integers obviously are whole numbers, and completely lack a fractional part. 

When Ruby handles integer division, any part of a calculation that results in a decimal will be truncated and not rounded. 

	puts 6/3
	puts 7/3
	puts 8/3
	puts 9/3

The output would be:

`2` 
`2` 
`2` 
`3`

Processing PostsController#update (for 127.0.0.1 at 2009-08-13 14:23:13) [PUT]
  Parameters: {"category"=>"2", "commit"=>"Update", "authenticity_token"=>"tAmLy3EUgFx3zbLt741/gTkN0HMxczOhybmfqwPBl/A=", "post"=>{"timestamp(2i)"=>"8", "timestamp(3i)"=>"13", "timestamp(4i)"=>"19", "body"=>"Introduction to Ruby\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nWritten by **Cyrus Lopez**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Introduction ###\r\n\r\nThis is going to be an accelerated introduction to the Ruby language. It is meant for the intermediate beginner. I assume you have some exposure to programming languages in general and do not require that much hand-holding.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to provide to you a top-down view of the Ruby language as a whole. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Printing and Variables ###\r\n\r\nThe very familiar (not to mention trite) hello world example is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tputs (\"Hello World!\")         # Say Hello World\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it in Ruby. As you continue, you are going to find that Ruby is all about making your life easier. That's part of the whole 'programer happiness' philosophy that Ruby subscribes to. Comments in code start with the hash (#) symbol. \r\n\r\nNote small things like parentheses are optional. The following code would work just the same:\r\n\r\n\tputs \"Hello World\"\r\n\r\nSince Ruby is a dynamic loosely-typed language, there is no need to declare or specify the type of variables. Variables can be named anything outside of the language keywords and they are case-sensitive. A common habit amongst Ruby programmers is to use descriptive variable names that are separated with an underscore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tfirst_name = \"cyrus\"\r\n\tlast_name = \"lopez\"\r\n\tfull_name = first_name + last_name\r\n\tputs full_name\r\n\r\nThe output would be:\r\n\r\n`cyrus lopez`\r\n\r\nNotice that the **+** operator works on strings. The Ruby interpreter will automatically figure out what you are trying to accomplish and do the most logical thing. \r\n\r\n\tone = 35\r\n\ttwo = 678\r\n\tsum = one + two\r\n\tputs sum\r\n\r\nThe output would be:\r\n\r\n`713`\r\n\r\nConstants are similar to variables, except, well, the values are not supposed to change. Ruby does support constants, but to a limited extent. \r\nAny variable name which begins with a capital letter will become a constant, however, Ruby will not stop you from changing the value of the constant. Instead, it will only throw a warning during run-time. \r\n\r\n\tTom = \"male\"\r\n\tputs Tom\r\n\tTom = \"Female\"\r\n\tputs Tom\r\n\r\nThe output would be:\r\n\r\n`male`  \r\n`test.rb:3: warning: already initialized constant Tom`  \r\n`Female`\r\n\r\n### Arithmetic ###\r\n\r\nDealing with basic arithmetic in Ruby is fairly standard. Ruby reduces your selection of numbers to be integers and floating-point numbers. Integers obviously are whole numbers, and completely lack a fractional part. \r\n\r\nWhen Ruby handles integer division, any part of a calculation that results in a decimal will be truncated and not rounded. \r\n\r\n\tputs 6/3\r\n\tputs 7/3\r\n\tputs 8/3\r\n\tputs 9/3\r\n\r\nThe output would be:\r\n\r\n`2`  \r\n`2`  \r\n`2`  \r\n`3`  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "title"=>"Unfinished Ruby Guide", "timestamp(5i)"=>"21", "timestamp(1i)"=>"2009"}, "id"=>"3"}

### Introduction ###

This is going to be an accelerated introduction to the Ruby language. It is meant for the intermediate beginner. I assume you have some exposure to programming languages in general and do not require that much hand-holding.

My goal is to provide to you a top-down view of the Ruby language as a whole. 


### Printing and Variables ###

The very familiar (not to mention trite) hello world example is:


	puts ("Hello World!") # Say Hello World


That''s all there is to it in Ruby. As you continue, you are going to find that Ruby is all about making your life easier. That''s part of the whole ''programer happiness'' philosophy that Ruby subscribes to. Comments in code start with the hash (#) symbol. 

Note small things like parentheses are optional. The following code would work just the same:

	puts "Hello World"

Since Ruby is a dynamic loosely-typed language, there is no need to declare or specify the type of variables. Variables can be named anything outside of the language keywords and they are case-sensitive. A common habit amongst Ruby programmers is to use descriptive variable names that are separated with an underscore.


	first_name = "cyrus"
	last_name = "lopez"
	full_name = first_name + last_name
	puts full_name

The output would be:

`cyrus lopez`

Notice that the **+** operator works on strings. The Ruby interpreter will automatically figure out what you are trying to accomplish and do the most logical thing. 

	one = 35
	two = 678
	sum = one + two
	puts sum

The output would be:

`713`

Constants are similar to variables, except, well, the values are not supposed to change. Ruby does support constants, but to a limited extent. 
Any variable name which begins with a capital letter will become a constant, however, Ruby will not stop you from changing the value of the constant. Instead, it will only throw a warning during run-time. 

	Tom = "male"
	puts Tom
	Tom = "Female"
	puts Tom

The output would be:

`male` 
`test.rb:3: warning: already initialized constant Tom` 
`Female`

### Arithmetic ###

Dealing with basic arithmetic in Ruby is fairly standard. Ruby reduces your selection of numbers to be integers and floating-point numbers. Integers obviously are whole numbers, and completely lack a fractional part. 

When Ruby handles integer division, any part of a calculation that results in a decimal will be truncated and not rounded. 

	puts 6/3
	puts 7/3
	puts 8/3
	puts 9/3

The output would be:

`2` 
`2` 
`2` 
`3`

Instead, it will only throw a warning during run-time. \r\n\r\n\tTom = \"male\"\r\n\tputs Tom\r\n\tTom = \"Female\"\r\n\tputs Tom\r\n\r\nThe output would be:\r\n\r\n`male`  \r\n`test.rb:3: warning: already initialized constant Tom`  \r\n`Female`\r\n\r\n### Arithmetic ###\r\n\r\nDealing with basic arithmetic in Ruby is fairly standard. Ruby reduces your selection of numbers to be integers and floating-point numbers. Integers obviously are whole numbers, and completely lack a fractional part. \r\n\r\nWhen Ruby handles integer division, any part of a calculation that results in a decimal will be truncated and not rounded. \r\n\r\n\tputs 6/3\r\n\tputs 7/3\r\n\tputs 8/3\r\n\tputs 9/3\r\n\r\nThe output would be:\r\n\r\n`2`  \r\n`2`  \r\n`2`  \r\n`3`  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "title"=>"Unfinished Ruby Guide", "timestamp(5i)"=>"21", "timestamp(1i)"=>"2009"}, "id"=>"3"}
