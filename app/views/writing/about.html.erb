<p>The inevitable description; rife with recriminations and a moratorium on sanity, surly and bitter. Yes; we have danced like this many times. Is it strange that I always find myself daunted by this little narrative?</p>
<p>My name should be evident from the text above. Look closer. I whittle my precious days away as a legal clerk, or by discussing meritless things. I am a consummate pessimist, and it shows. If I were a color, I would be the color of disappointment. I believe that is mauve. I haven't cracked my skull open and checked, but I'm pretty sure you will find it painted lavender. Go ahead. I will wait.</p>
<p>In no logical order, I have expressed affinity for the following at some point: <abbr>music, books, pleasant textures, breathing correctly, table manners, cold pizza, digital art, analog watches, dystopia, good science fiction, bad movies, vanilla, things that go boom, ball point pens, honey-nut cheerios, interstellar propulsion systems, language, citrus, penne pasta, advil liqui-gels, sensible paradoxes, cold weather, rainy days, insomnia, immediacy, warm tea, visible light, tense situations, grim darkness</abbr> and <abbr>obsession<abbr>.</p>
<p>This byzantine glance should illustrate a few key things. Directionally, your guess is as good as mine. Do not get lost, I cannot find you. My spoon is too big.</p>
